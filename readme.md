I'm trying out Authorea service for collaborative writing. It looks quite promising:

- Markdown editing with feature-rich web-editor (Pandoc + MathJax)
- Overall academic writing focus
- Github integration
- [Commenting](https://www.authorea.com/users/9932/articles/13560) on the document (discussion/supervision)
- Advanced and easy [citing](https://www.authorea.com/users/9932/articles/12628) (with BibTeX bibliography)
- Collaborative editing with some kind review/approve interface and conflicts resolution
- Storing [datasets, pictures and bibliography](https://www.authorea.com/users/9932/articles/11070) together with the article
- Export to LaTeX/Word/PDF (HTML?)
- A big library of [templates](https://www.authorea.com/templates) for scientific journals
- Convenient [pricing](https://www.authorea.com/user_plans): 1 private project for free, different individual/team plans for more
- Actively developed (open [roadmap](https://www.authorea.com/users/3/articles/121541))
