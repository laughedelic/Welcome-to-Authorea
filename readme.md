I'm trying out Authorea service for collaborative writing. It looks quite promising:

- Markdown editing with feature-rich web-editor (Pandoc + MathJax)
- Overall academic writing focus
- Github integration
- Commenting on the document (discussion/supervision)
- Advanced (compared to similar services) citing
- Collaborative editing with some kind review/approve interface and conflicts resolution
- Storing datasets, pictures and bibliography together with the article
- Export to LaTeX/Word/PDF (HTML?)
- Templates with a big library for various journals
- Convenient [pricing](https://www.authorea.com/user_plans): 1 private project for free, different individual/team plans for more
- Actively developed (open [roadmap](https://www.authorea.com/users/3/articles/121541))
