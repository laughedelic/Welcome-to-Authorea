# Found bugs

- Leaving some section empty results in an error message:  
  ![](figures/empty-paragraph-bug.png)  
- Pushing to Github manually doesn't affect the document. But I can see the commit in the History tab on Authorea. If I open The post in incognito-mode, I see the latest version, but the logged-in editor shows me the old one.
